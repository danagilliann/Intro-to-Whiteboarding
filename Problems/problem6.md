Given a group of people, organize a beer exchange so that each person is randomly assigned a person to receive a beer from, and give a beer to. Note: no person can receive a beer from the same person they gave one to.

```
Example input: Mari, Jeff, Sheldon, Abhi, Jane
```

```
Example output: Jeff gives a beer to Mari. Mari gives a beer to Sheldon. Sheldon gives a beer to Jane. Jane gives a beer to Abhi. Abhi gives a beer to Jeff.
```

Make sure to think of the edge cases that could cause your algorithm to fail!
